      This is the java binding to the libvirt library.

To use it, your program needs to access both the java library (.jar file),
and the JNI library (.so file)

1. You must have the libvirt.jar file in your classpath.
By default the installs it to @prefix@/share/java/libvirt-@VERSION@.jar

2. You must have the libvirt_jni.so accessible by the dynamic linker.
By default the RPM installs it to /usr/lib or /usr/lib64, so the linker will
find it automatically. If it's in a different location, you have to set
the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to the directory containing the libvirt_jni.so
file.

There is a rudimentary functional test program that the libvirt-java-devel
installs put it into @prefix@/share/doc/libvirt-java-devel-@VERSION@/test.java

To run it, first copy the test.java file to writeable directory
cp @prefix@/share/doc/libvirt-java-devel-@VERSION@/test.java ~

Compile the java file to a class:
javac -classpath @prefix@/share/java/libvirt-@VERSION@.jar test.java

Then run the program:
java -classpath .:@prefix@/share/java/libvirt-@VERSION@.jar test

There is full javadoc for the API in @prefix@/share/javadoc/libvirt-java-@VERSION@/
