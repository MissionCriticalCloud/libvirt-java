The current build procedure is based on the
classic:
  tar xvzf libvirt-java-xxx.tar.gz
  cd libvirt-java
  ./configure [--prefix=/usr] ; make ; make install

of course if provided, ant based XML config files or
Eclipse one will be integrated.

When building from a CVS checkout you need instead to
run autogen.sh [--prefix=/usr] to build the configure,
since ti's a generated file it's not commited in CVS.
