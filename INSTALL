The current build procedure is based on the
classic:
  tar xvzf libvirt-java-xxx.tar.gz
  cd libvirt-java
  ./configure [--prefix=/usr] ; make ; make install

You will need a Java Development Kit accepting the version 1.5
of the language since the bindings use enums which were added
in that version.

You can select the Java Development Kit to use by providing
a --with-java-home=path_to_jdk_directory configure argument
or by using the JAVA_HOME environment variable. This can
be useful if you have multiple JDK installed or if it is
installed in a non standard path.

Please report any compatibility problem to the libvirt
mailing list at:
 https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/libvir-list

Of course if provided, ant based XML config files or
Eclipse one will be integrated to the source distribution
but they are not yet available.

When building from a CVS checkout you need instead to
run autogen.sh [--prefix=/usr] to build the configure,
since it's a generated file it's not commited in CVS.
